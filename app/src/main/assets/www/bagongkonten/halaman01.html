    <strong>There&rsquo;s a simple method to get a whopping 60,000 XP in 30 minutes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Players have worked out a method to get huge XP gains in a short space of time, and interestingly, it involves using the game&rsquo;s weakest and most Pok&eacute;mon &ndash; Pidgey, Weedle and Caterpie &ndash; with lots and lots of Candy, netting you tens of thousands of experience in a single sitting:</p>

    <strong>Pok&eacute;mon Go is getting seasonal updates</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Like most &lsquo;live&rsquo; games, Pok&eacute;mon Go will receive regular seasonal updates. Starting in October, the game received a week-long Pok&eacute;mon Go&rsquo;s Halloween event that increased the appearance rate of select &lsquo;spooky&rsquo; creatures and also increased Candy drop rates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    It was then followed by a Double XP and Stardust Thanksgiving event in November, and while Niantic hasn&rsquo;t confirmed more on the way, it&rsquo;s probably very likely. We&rsquo;re not sure what festive Pokemon would appear round Christmas, but we&rsquo;re sure the rewards would be good.</p>
